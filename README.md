## **Getting Started**

Ready to get Centsible up and running on your local machine? Follow these simple steps:

### **1. Clone the Repository**
First, you'll need to copy the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### **2. Navigate to the Project Folder**
Move into the project's root directory:
```bash
cd <repository-directory>
```

### **3. Set Up Your Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Firebase keys. This is crucial for the app to connect to Firebase services.

### **4. Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have all the necessary packages installed by running:
```bash
npm install
```

---

## **Available Scripts**

We've set up several scripts to help you manage and develop the application efficiently. Here's a quick rundown:

### **Optimized Build**
Need to run the app with an optimized production build? Just execute:
```bash
npm start
```
This command does two things:
- Builds the app using `react-scripts build` for a production-ready version.
- Serves the application concurrently for a smooth experience.

---

### **Development Mode**
Working on new features? Start the app in development mode with live updates and Firebase emulators:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will:
- Launch the React frontend with `react-scripts start`.
- Start Firebase emulators for authentication and Firestore with `firebase emulators:start --only auth,firestore`.

---

### **Frontend Only (Live Updates)**
If you only need to work on the frontend and want live updates, use:
```bash
npm run react
```
This simply runs:
- `react-scripts start` to kick off the React development server.

---

### **Create a Static Optimized Build**
To generate a static, optimized version of the React app, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command executes:
- `react-scripts build` to bundle your app for production.

---

### **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
Ready to share your awesome work? Deploy the optimized build to GitHub Pages with:
```bash
npm run predeploy
npm run deploy
```
Here's what happens:
1. `npm run build` creates the optimized build.
2. `gh-pages -d build` deploys the build to GitHub Pages.
